200+ Systems in the bank Read-> Collector

Collector is responsible of:-
• Connections to the bank systems (JDBC
connections)
• Collect the data from each system.
• Validate the structure of the data and the data itself.
• Manipulate and handle cases where the data could be missing or in wrong format.
• Write output into the UAM centralized DB.
and also -> Write UAM Centralized DB


Brain/Orchestrator
• Read & write on UAM centralized DB : UAM centralized DB <--->Brain  Orchestrator
• Contains many services that handle different responsibilities (ex: Authentication, mailing, data manipulation... etc.)
• Contains business logic.
Contains scheduled jobs that can be configured.
Orchestrator <-> Collector : request & response ex:run manual jobs
Orchestrator <-> Front-end(Console):  Request & response  Login, Configuration, Connections




ex
Front-end (Console)
• Reads from the centralized DB
Displays the data through tables and reports.
• Makes requests to the brain (REST APIs) for certain operations like the authentication.
• Allows interfacing with configuration options.


UAM Centralized DB

Contains all the tables that are used in the modules of the system.
• Tables are filled from the Collector and Brain.
• Data from the Collector will be used directly by the front-end or it will be taken as "input" to the brain.
• Brain will take "input" data and apply business logic and write it on the DB, this is called "output" data.
• Table name standard is all capitalized separated with underscore.
• There are table types according to the information they hold (ex: log, imported, lookup... etc.)
